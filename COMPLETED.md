# COMPLETED

## [Visual Design Pass] — Leg 2 — 2026-09-02
Full re-skin off a token-based CSS system: dark (default) and light palettes pulled from
Diamond/Pearl's Palkia/Dialga pairing per Vanny's direction, muted/desaturated rather
than anime-vivid; light only surfaces via OS-level `prefers-color-scheme` (no in-app
toggle — see TODO.md). global.css split into tokens/base/buttons/layout/tables/modals.css
to stay under the file-size convention. App.tsx gained an `.app-shell`/`.app-header`/
`.app-content` wrapper (markup-only, no behavior change). See commit `<pending>`.

## [Nav Restructuring: Expand Top Tabs] — Leg 1 — 2026-09-02
Trainer Profiles and Storage Locations became their own top-level tabs alongside Living
Dex/Collection; Backup/Update controls moved to persistent chrome above the tabs; the
Completion Stats panel folded into the Living Dex tab. Pure UI reorg in App.tsx, no schema
or logic changes. See commit `f8581ee`.

Living Dex v1 milestones — a separate, earlier numbering that collides with but predates
this one) archived at `docs/completed-archive/project-scaffold.md` and
